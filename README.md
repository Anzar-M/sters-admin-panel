## Context & Notes
- The project was originally designed for Firebase, but migrated to Supabase mid-way to meet evolving requirements.
- I focused on modularity and separation of concerns so that admin, faculty, and student functionalities can be organized cleanly.
- Due to academic timelines, security features like password hashing and advanced role-based access were planned but not fully implemented.
